# kaggle
Kaggle Projects/Comps:
* The Titanic dataset I used the models SVC and RandomForestClassifier. The SVC scored better than both models of the RandomForestClassifier. The second RandomForestClassifier was built using hyper parameter combinations the newly (scikit version 0.24.1) HalvingRandomSearchCV had output.
* The second titanic.ipynb is an attempt to use classifiers to classify the Cabins since there were such a large number of NaN for that column. 

Some attempts at Kaggle datasets in order to apply what I've learned through "here and there" techniques and apply my understanding of algorithms and techniques that were taught/explained through: 
* <u>Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow</u>
